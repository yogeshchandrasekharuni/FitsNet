An epilepsy-causing video detection software

### Hi there
- You're early! This is still a work-in-progress. When finished, it will be able to detect if a video is likely to induces seizures to an epiletic person.
- Interested in contributing to this project? Please feel free to open an issue or contact me at yogeshchandrasekharuni@gmail.com :)
